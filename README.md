# Knapsack 0/1 problem solver
Powered by React

## What problem?
Knapsack 0/1 is a mathematical algorithmic problem. It is easily elaborated by imagining a sack and a bunch of items. The sack can hold items worth of X weight, while each potential item has both a weight (X) and value (Y). The goal is to fit in as much value (Y) as possible without breaking the sack.

A Wikipedia article detailing problem can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem#0.2F1_knapsack_problem

## Features
The problem solver was created for a solo school project, and frankly, beefed up for fun. You can add custom items with custom values and change the size of the sack. Everything works through React.js (without Flux or Flux-based libraries) and the code has some ES2015 syntax. Oh and the site's responsive, naturally (as if anything wasn't these days).

## Key learnings
Should have used Redux for global state (not passing along states between components) or skipped React altogether and just make the page the good ol' static way with vanilla JS or a little jQuery shenanigans. ES2015 was again great as usual and .map() was priceless.
